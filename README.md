## rFXGen Usage

Open the tools and use buttons/slider to generate sounds in real-time for your games.
Sounds could be saved as .rfx (sound generation parameters) and also exported to .wav as sample data. 
rFXGen ONE also allows exporting sounds as .raw sample data and as a plain code byte array (.h)

rFXGen ONE comes with a powerful command line for sounds generation and manipulation. Just type on command line:

 > rfxgen.exe --help
