## rFXGen Usage

Open the tools and use buttons/slider to generate in real time the desired 8-bit sounds for your games.
Sounds could be saved as .rfx (sound generation parameters) and also exported to .wav as sample data. 
rFXGen ONE also allows exporting sounds as .raw sample data and a plain code byte array (.h)

rFXGen ONE also comes with a powerful command line for sounds generation and manipulation. Just type on command line:

 > rfxgen.exe --help
